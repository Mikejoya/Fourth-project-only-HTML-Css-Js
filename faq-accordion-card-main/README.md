##### Problems

> Reinforcing learning of HTML, Css, JavaScript.
I know that the challenge clarifies that we will not use javascript, but I decided to use js, because I want to improve my skills. one of the problems was making one window close when opening another. Because I didn't know how to involve a function that would help me I had to do a lot of research.


###### learned
Learning about conditional functions in JavaScript.
